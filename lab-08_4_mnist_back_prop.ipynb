    "3. **Gradient of the Loss with Respect to `w2`**:\n",
    "   - The gradient of the loss with respect to `w2` is computed by multiplying the transpose of `a1` by the gradient of the loss with respect to `l2`. This step uses the chain rule to propagate the gradient through the linear transformation.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Gradient of the Loss with Respect to `a1`**:\n",
    "   - The gradient of the loss with respect to `a1` is computed by multiplying the gradient of the loss with respect to `l2` by the transpose of `w2`. This step uses the chain rule to propagate the gradient backward through the weights of the second layer.\n",
